# MD-Scripts

Collection of scripts for analysis of Molecular Dynamics (MD) trajectories which I have written over the years. The scripts are written in Python and are mostly based on GROMACS simulation results. The scripts are mostly written for my own use, but I have tried to make them as general as possible. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, please let me know.

## Requirements

The scripts are written in Python 3 and require the following packages:
*SciPy
*Pandas
*Matplotlib
*Numpy
